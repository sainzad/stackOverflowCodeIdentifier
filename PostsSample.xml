For example an algorithm is cubic if its complexity is $O(n^3)$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about when the complexity depends on several inputs? For example if an algorithm has complexity $O(n^2k)$, is it 'cubic', or maybe 'quadratic in $n$ and linear in $k$'?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also seen phrases such as 'cubic in $k$ and $n$'; what does this mean exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="47004" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-02-26T17:54:25.477" LastActivityDate="2016-02-26T17:54:25.477" Title="Complexity of an algorithm with multiple inputs" Tags="&lt;algorithm-analysis&gt;&lt;landau-notation&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="5" ClosedDate="2016-02-26T17:55:23.230" />
