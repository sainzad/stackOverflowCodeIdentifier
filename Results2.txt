Code: When waiting upon a Condition a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur in general as a concession to the underlying platform semantics This has little practical impact on most application programs as a Condition should always be waited upon in a loop testing the state predicate that is being waited for An implementation is free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can occur and so always wait in a loop If the current thread s interrupted status is set when it enters this method or it is interrupted while waiting it will continue to wait until signalled When it finally returns from this method its interrupted status will still be set
